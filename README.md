# BathSoap_Clustering_Project
Scenario Overview
We perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on a bath soap dataset. This involves grouping customers into clusters based on their purchasing behavior, preferences, or other features in the data. Here's a breakdown of what we'll need to do:

Data Preprocessing:

Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset: we will first load the dataset and clean it if necessary (e.g., handling missing values, normalizing data).
Dimensionality Reduction with PCA (if necessary): Principal Component Analysis (PCA) might reduce the number of features while retaining most of the data's variability.
Model Development:

Implement K-Means Clustering: we'll apply the K-Means algorithm to group customers into clusters.
Determine Optimal Number of Clusters: Methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score will be used to decide the best number of clusters.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate Clustering Results: Use metrics like the Silhouette Score to evaluate the clustering qualityf.
Interpretation: Understand and explain what the clusters represent.
Deliverables:

Flowchart: A diagram that shows the steps of the clustering process.
Process Description: A detailed explanation of the steps, focusing on feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and clustering.
Evaluation Report: A report that presents the results, explains the significance of the clusters, and evaluates the model's effectiveness.
